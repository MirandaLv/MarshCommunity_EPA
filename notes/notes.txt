Data processing of polygon data, and creating the labeled points for training the model.
1. Fixing geometry errors of each polygons representing the locations of the marsh community.
- QGIS tool: vector geometry -> Fix geometries, the fixed polygon shapefiles are saved under the data/processing_data/vectors/...
2. Randomly generate sample points from each marsh community polygons
- QGIS tool: vector -> research tools -> Random points in Extents
- Maryus_juncus: 1000 points
- Select points that are within the fixed geometry Maryus_juncus file.
- Save to RandomPoints_Maryus_Juncus.geojson

- CaptSinclairJuncus: Random points in Polygons (200 points, minimum distance between points 10m, Random seed 100).
- Save to RandomPoints_Capt_Juncus.geojson

- CaptAlternaflora: Fix geometry; Random points in Extents; Number of points: 500; Minimum distance between points (5m), because of the spatial extent, if setting the minimum distance 10m as the same as the Maryus juncus layer, there will be no random points generated)
- Save to RandomPoints_Capt_Alterniflora.geojson

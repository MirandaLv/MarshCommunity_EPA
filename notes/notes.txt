## All raw data are collected in projection EPSG:32618, except data from BrownsBay, before running analysis for BrownsBay, the data is reprojected to EPSG:32618.

Data processing of polygon data, and creating the labeled points for training the model.
1. Fixing geometry errors of each polygons representing the locations of the marsh community.
- QGIS tool: vector geometry -> Fix geometries, the fixed polygon shapefiles are saved under the data/processing_data/vectors/...
2. Randomly generate sample points from each marsh community polygons
- QGIS tool: vector -> research tools -> Random points in Extents

Maryus_juncus
- Maryus_juncus: 1000 points
- Select points that are within the fixed geometry Maryus_juncus file.
- Save to RandomPoints_Maryus_Juncus.geojson

CaptSinclairJuncus
- CaptSinclairJuncus: Random points in Polygons (200 points, minimum distance between points 10m, Random seed 100).
- Save to RandomPoints_Capt_Juncus.geojson

CaptAlternaflora
- CaptAlternaflora: Fix geometry; Random points in Extents; Number of points: 500; Minimum distance between points (5m), because of the spatial extent, if setting the minimum distance 10m as the same as the Maryus juncus layer, there will be no random points generated)
- Save to RandomPoints_Capt_Alterniflora.geojson

BrownsbayAlternaflora
- Fix geometry
- Remove polygons that are overlapped with BrownsbayJuncus
- Random points in Extent (Number of points 2000, minimum distance between points 5m) -> 2000 points.
- Extract the points that are within and overlap with BrownsbayAlternaflora -> 801.
- Since the Juncus layer is overlapped with the BrownsbayAlternaflora geometry, extract points that are within and overlap with BrownsbayJuncus -> 189 within BrownsbayJuncus, and save as random points representing Juncus in Brownsbay (RandomPoints_BrownBay_Juncus.shp)
- Save the rest points as random points representing Alternaflora in Brownsbay (RandomPoints_BrownBay_Alternaflora.shp).


All sample points data
- Combine all the above random points created from CaptSinclair, Maryus, and Brownsbay -> Sample_combined.geojson

## Zooming to the study area
- Select a region of interest (ROI) from the TMI, and save it as VA_TMI_selected.geojson.
- The extent of VA_TMI_selected.geojson is used to clip the composite image and the dem.
- DEM is projected to EPSG:32618, and the resolution is 1m.
- The composite image is projected to EPSG:32618, and the resolution is 3m.

## Running the data_processing.py to get a geojson file, which saves the coordinates of each sample point, and the corresponding image band/DEM values.

## Running the data_analysis_all.py to get the training and testing data, and train the model with each algorithm.

## Running the descriptive_analysis.py to get the descriptive statistics of the sample data in general.


To-do:
- Research on the soil index, and add the soil index to the model.
- Research water moisture index, and add the water moisture index to the model.
- Seasonal analysis: compare the model performance in composite images acquired from different seasons.
- Add the boxplot of each feature information in the descriptive analysis.
